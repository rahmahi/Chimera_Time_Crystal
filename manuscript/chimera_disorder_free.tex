		Chimera states are a captivating occurrence in which a system comprised of multiple interconnected elements exhibits a distinctive combination of synchronized and de-synchronized behavior. The emergence of these states can be attributed to the complex interdependence between quantum entanglement and the delicate balance of interactions among system constituents. The emergence of Discrete Time Crystal (DTC) in typical many-body periodically driven systems occurs when there is a breaking of time translation symmetry. Coexisting coupled DTC and a ferromagnetic dynamically many-body localized (DMBL) phase at distinct regions have been investigated under the controlled spin rotational error of a disorder-free spin-1/2 chain for different types of spin-spin interactions. We contribute a novel approach for the emergence of the DTC-DMBL-Chimera phase, which is robust against external static fields in a periodically driven quantum many-body system.

	Symmetry is a fundamental concept in physics, offering valuable perspectives on the identification of conservation laws, the formulation of novel theories such as gauge theory~\cite{Yang_1954}, and the understanding of many-body physics. Symmetry and its breaking, specifically spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), are fundamental factors in the formulation of the phases of matter in condensed matter physics. SSB has manifested at various scales, including the Higgs mechanism in high-energy physics, cosmology, and  Bose-Einstein condensation  in cold atoms, among other instances~\cite{krasnov_spontaneous_2012, sadler_spontaneous_2006, vanderbruggen_spontaneous_2015}.

In solid-state physics, matter is characterized by the presence of crystalline order, which arises due to continuous translational symmetry breaking in space. Motivated by the equivalence between space and time in relativistic theory, it becomes possible to contemplate SSB occurring along the temporal axis, leading to the emergence of a novel phase of matter. In 2012, Frank Wilczek presented a theoretical framework pertaining to the concept of \textit{time translation symmetry breaking} (TTSB) in the context of quantum mechanical systems~\cite{wilczek_quantum_2012}. In another paper, Shapere and Wilczek proposed TTSB for a classical system~\cite{shapere_classical_2012}. This unveils a new state of matter, $\textit{Time Crystals}$ (TC), where the ground state of the system possesses its own dynamics, distinct from external influence~\cite{wilczek_quantum_2012}, which arises from the intrinsic properties and interactions among the system constituents. Additionally, to sustain the periodicity of the TC, the necessary energy originates from external fields. Wilczek's proposed TC was an equilibrium state of matter where continuous time translation symmetry was broken. {Bruno commented that Wilczek's proposed rotating soliton should not be the correct ground state  corresponding to the proposed model\cite{Bruno_comment_1}. Bruno also pointed out a contradiction regarding energy-conservation principle due to periodic motion in ground state for a wide range of systems, regardless of their composition and interactions (\textit{the no-go theorem})\cite{Bruno2013}. In addition}, Oshikawa and Watanabe proved {in another no-go theorem} that the TC cannot exist in thermal equilibrium  ~\cite{watanabe_absence_2015}. Their proof does not reject the possibility of a TC  existing in a non-equilibrium system, such as Floquet systems. Hence, the Floquet time crystal (or Discrete time crystal, abbreviated as DTC) was proposed, in which discrete, rather than continuous symmetry, is broken~\cite{else_floquet_2016}.

	In a generic DTC, strong disorder-induced \textit{Many-Body Localization} (MBL) is required for long-term stability~\cite{zhang_observation_2017}. MBL prevents DTC from thermalizing, without which every part of the system
	would regard the rest of the system as a heat-bath, eventually reaching thermal equilibrium~\cite{alet_many-body_2018,else_floquet_2016,smith_many-body_2016,nguyen_signature_2021}.  DTCs have been experimentally realized in several different many-body systems, such as arrays of ion-trapped spins~\cite{huang2018,taheri_all-optical_2022, Soham2018, zhang_observation_2017, yao_time_2018,sacha_modeling_2015}, qubits ~\cite{frey_realization_2022}, ordered dipolar $NH_4H_2PO_4$~\cite{rovny_observation_2018}, by bouncing ultracold atoms on oscillating mirrors~\cite{sacha_time_nodate,golletz_basis_2022}, and others. Alternatively, disorder-free DTCs can be created by direct quenches, delta-kicks, and other periodic driving methods~\cite{else_prethermal_2017, russomanno_spin_2017, ho_critical_2017, yu2019, russomanno_floquet_2017}.  Recent works have explored other prospects for constructing stable DTCs, namely through the emergence of disorder-free \textit{Dynamical Many-Body Localization} (DMBL)  by applying an external time-periodic drive~\cite{Keser2016, haldar_dynamical_2017, haldar_dynamical_2021,bhattacharyya_transverse_2012,aditya2023dynamical,dutta2014,das_exotic_2010}. In this manuscript, we investigate the \textit{Dynamical Localization} (DL) of TCs via \textit{Coherent Destruction of Tunneling} (CDT/DL). In CDT, the quantum tunneling of electrons through a classically insurmountable potential barrier is suppressed by applying a time-periodic drive with specific amplitude and frequency~\cite{Grossmann1991, Ashhab2007}. While CDT has been observed in systems where the transfer matrix element is small or finite,  the infinite dimensional counterpart of CDT, is also possible~\cite{das_exotic_2010, Roy2015}. In both CDT and CDT/DL, the system is localized at the initial state for infinite time\cite{Kayanuma2008}.
	
	In classical systems, the coexistence of coupled spontaneous synchronized and de-synchronized  dynamics has been known to emerge in the dynamics of coupled systems of identical oscillators. This type of emergent behavior is called a \textit{Chimera State}~\cite{kuramoto_coexistence_2002, panaggio_chimera_2015, parastesh_chimeras_2021}. Chimeras can also be realized in quantum many body systems, and chimera order has been investigated as a quantum phase of matter~\cite{bastidas_quantum_2015}. In recent decades, interest has risen in the possibility of realizing chimeras in magnetic systems. Here, magnetic order and disorder co-exist in systems of interacting quantum spins that can be represented by the quantum Ising model~\cite{singh_chimera_2011}.  Recent advancements in this domain involve the formation of a \textit{chimera time crystalline order}, as reported by Sakurai \textit{et. al.}~\cite{sakurai_phys_nodate}, where stable chimeras were obtained by the application of disorder in a one-dimensional interacting spin-1/2 chain.
	
	In this article, we investigate whether a chimera consisting of a DTC and a CDT/DL-localized ferromagnetic state can coexist simultaneously in a one-dimensional spin-1/2 chain driven by external time-periodic drives. We have employed a periodically driven transverse field that breaks $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in a one-dimensional \textit{disorder-free} quantum spin-$1/2$ chain with long-range power-law decay in the Heisenberg exchange. We present our work as follows: In section~\ref{sec:mdl_n_dynam}, we describe the proposed spin model. In section~\ref{sec:level2}, we describe the emergence of DMBL. In section ~\ref{sec:level3}, we numerically investigate the coexistence of time crystal and DMBL phases, and support our results analytically. In section ~\ref{sec:level4}, we look at regional magnetization and  entanglement entropy for the system, and in section~\ref{sec:level6}, we explore the robustness of this chimera against  external static fields. Finally, we discuss our results and conclude.	
	
	\section{\label{sec:mdl_n_dynam} The Model and System Dynamics}
	We consider a one-dimensional spin-1/2 chain with N sites. In the chain, all sites are connected via the Heisenberg interaction in the $y$ spin axis. We then add a transverse field that is being driven in time with period $T$. In addition, the system is modulated by two repeating sequences of pulse waves, both with the same time periods $T$.  The first sequence has a pulse width $T_1$, and modulates the static transverse fields acting on the $x$ spin axis. The second  sequence has pulse width $T_2=T-T_1$, and modulates  both the interactions and the time-periodic drive in the transverse field for the $z$ spin axis. Thus, the full Hamiltonian is time-periodic with a period $T=T_1+T_2$, and is given by,
	\begin{align}
		\hat{H}(t) = 
		\begin{cases}
			\hat{H_1} , & 0\leq t < T_1,\\
			\hat{H_2} , & T_1\leq t < T,
		\end{cases}
		\label{eq:cleanham}
	\end{align}
	where,
	\begin{align}
		\hat{H_1} = & \hbar g (1-\epsilon_A) \sum_{\substack{\\i \in A}}\hat{\sigma}^x_i + \hbar g (1-\epsilon_B) \sum_{i \in B}\hat{\sigma}^x_i+ \hbar\hat{V}(\hat{\sigma}^{\gamma}),\label{eq:sysham1}\\
		\hat{H_2} = & \hbar\sum_{ij} J_{ij} \hat{\sigma}^y_i \hat{\sigma}^y_{j} +  \hbar h_D \sum_i \hat{\sigma}^z_i + \hbar\hat{V}(\hat{\sigma}^{\gamma}),
		\label{eq:sysham2}
	\end{align}
	and $\hat{\sigma}^{\mu=x,y,z}_i$ are the Pauli matrices at $i$-th site.  Henceforth, we shall simplify our analysis by assuming that the pulse waves modulating these Hamiltonians have a $50 \%$ duty-cycle, \textit{i.e.} $T_1=T_2=T/2$.  The Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_1$ in Eq~\ref{eq:sysham1} represents a transverse field that can perform spin-flips on spins polarized in the direction of the drive. To realize the DTC phase on the chain, we set an \textit{ideal value} of this field to $g=\pi/T$. Now, we divide the chain into two physical regions denoted by $A$ and $B$, based on two relative deviations $\epsilon_{A/B}\in[0,1]$ of the field from this ideal value. Thus, these deviation parameters are \textit{rotational errors} for the two regions, and play an essential role in differentiating between the two regions~\footnote{For instance, when $\epsilon_A \sim 0$ and $\epsilon_B \sim 1$, the field in region-A cause imperfect spin-flips, while that in region-B do not flip most spins.}. 
	\begin{figure}[t!]

		\includegraphics[width=7.cm]{pic_regions.pdf}
		\caption{Spin-flips that arise in the spin-$1/2$ chain due to the dynamics described in Eqns~\ref{eq:sysham1} and~\ref{eq:sysham2}, where the system is broken into two regions, $A$ (left panels) and $B$ (right panels). Snapshots at times $t=0, T_1, T, T+T_1 $ and $t=2T$ are represented from the top to bottom panels respectively. The spins at region $B$ remain unaltered for all time. In region $A$, spins are flipped at $T_1$ and preserved by CDT/DL during the $T_2-$cycle until $t=T_1+T_2=T$. In the next $T_1-$cycle, they are flipped back and preserved again by CDT/DL again until $t=2T$. Thus, region $A$ has a \textit{period-doubling} response from $t=0$ $t=2T$.}
		\label{Fig:spinflip}
	\end{figure}
	The Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_2$ in Eq.\eqref{eq:sysham2} represents a standard long-range spin-chain in $1-$dimension. The first term models the interaction between two sites $(i>j)$ with a coupling strength $J_{ij}$, assumed to follow a power law decay $J_{ij}={J_0}/{|i-j|^\beta}$. We have adapted Buyskikh's benchmarking ~\cite{buyskikh_entanglement_2016} to classify the scaling of spin-spin interaction by varying $\beta$. According to this classification, when $\beta\in\left[0,1\right)$, the interaction is classified as \textit{long-range}, with $\beta=0$ called the \textit{all-to-all} interaction; the range $\beta\in \left(1,2\right)$, as \textit{intermediate-range} interaction; the range $\beta > 2$ as the  \textit{short range} interaction, with $\beta= \infty$ called the \textit{nearest-neighbor} interaction. The second term in $\hat{H}_2$ is a continuous transverse time-periodic drive $\displaystyle \hat{H}_D=\hbar h_D \sum_i\hat{\sigma}^z_i$, where $\displaystyle h_D = -h\sin{(\omega t)}$, and $h,\omega$ are the amplitude and frequency (respectively) of the drive. We have considered $\omega$ to be sufficiently high such that $\omega\gg J_0$. 	Experimentally, this can be accomplished using external high-frequency drives whose time-scales are significantly shorter than the relaxation rate due to the interactions in $\hat{H}_2$.~\cite{choi_observation_2017,zhang_observation_2017,Cirac_1995,Blatt_2012}. At specific values of $h$ and $\omega$, our model shows a dynamical state that facilitates the manifestation of CDT/DL, which prevents the system from rapid thermalization. We will elaborate on this in section~\ref{sec:level2}. The final term in both $\hat{H}_{1,2}$, in Eqns~\ref{eq:sysham1}, and~\ref{eq:sysham2}, is $\displaystyle \hat{V}(\hat{\sigma}^{\gamma}) \equiv\gamma  \sum_{i=1}^{N} (\hat{\sigma}^x_i + \hat{\sigma}^y_i)$. It serves as a controlled additional static field that operates in the $x$ and $y$ spin axes.  This term can also be interpreted as a static magnetic imperfection that is modulated by a parameter $\gamma$. We have chosen to ignore this by default, and re-introduce it in section\ref{sec:level6} in order to investigate the robustness of the chimera against such imperfections.
	
	We populate the spins in a fully polarized product state of up-spins, as depicted in the top panel of Fig.~\ref{Fig:spinflip}. During the $T_1-$cycle of the pulses,  the spins in region A \textit{ideally} undergo a \textit{spin-flip} resulting in a spin-down orientation, while the spins situated within region B, remain ideally unaltered. If the dynamics in the $T_2-$cycle of the pulses remains localized by CDT/DL, this state of affairs is continued to the time $t=T$, as depicted in the next lower panel of Fig.~\ref{Fig:spinflip}. The localization ensures that each of the spins of the system are independent of each other, preventing any growth of correlations or entanglement between them during this cycle. Now, when the $T_1-$cycle repeats, the spins are flipped back to their initial condition, while the dynamics remains localized during the next $T_2-$cycle due to CDT/DL. Thus, when the system is driven up to the next time period $2T$, a spin magnetization \textit{period doubling}~\cite{rovny_31mathrmp_2018, Pan2020}, or \textit{half-frequency subharmonic} response is expected. 
	
	\section{\label{sec:level2} Interacting Dynamical Localization}
	
	Before investigating the chimera order in our model, we explain how the Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_2$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:cleanham} exhibits CDT/DL by analytically solving for the dynamics during all $T_2-$cycles. During these times,  the system is driven by a sinusoidal transverse periodic drive $h_D$ as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{Fig:time_distribution}.
	\begin{figure}
		\begin{center}
			\includegraphics[width=7.5cm]{drive_distribution.pdf}
		\end{center}
		\caption[]{Pictorial realization of the temporal progression of external drive for two time periods. The drive is considered in such a way that a spin-flip constant drive $\hat{H_1}$ acts during $T_1$(blue curve) and the periodic drive part of $\hat{H_2}$ in $T_2$(red dashed curve). The ordinate is amplitude and abscissa denotes n'th time period.}
		\label{Fig:time_distribution}
	\end{figure}	
	Let us employ the \textit{moving frame method}~\cite{haldar_dynamical_2021}, where a unitary transformation ia performed to the instantaneous rest frame of the rotation representing the drive. The transformation on the state yields $\ket{\psi(t)}_{mov} = \hat{U}^\dagger(t_0,t) \ket{\psi(t)}$, where 
	\begin{equation}
		\hat{U}(t_0,t) \equiv \blue{\mathcal{T}} e^{-\frac{i}{\hbar}\int_{t_0}^{t} dt' \hat{H}_D}.
		\label{eq:rot1}
	\end{equation}
	During the first $T_2-$cycle, $t \in{\Big[\frac{T}{2}, T \Big]}$. Thus,
	\begin{align}
		\hat{U}\left(T/2,t\right) =& \exp \Bigg[-\frac{i}{\hbar}\int_{T/2}^{t+T/2} (-h \sin(\omega t'))dt'\hbar\sum_i\hat{\sigma}^z_i\Bigg]\nonumber\\
		=& \prod_{i} \exp\Big[-i \hat{\sigma}^z_i\zeta(t))\Big],
	\end{align}	
	where, $\displaystyle{
		\zeta (t) = h\int_{T/2}^{T/2+t}  \Big[-\sin(\omega t')dt'\Big]=  \frac{h}{\omega}\Big[1-\cos(\omega t)\Big]}$.		
	Now, in this 'rotating frame', the Hamiltonian transforms to~\cite{haldar_dynamical_2021},
	\begin{align}
		\hat{H}^{mov}(t) &= \hat{U}^\dagger \hat{H}_2(t) \hat{U}- i \hat{U}^\dagger \partial_t \hat{U}\nonumber\\
		&= \hat{U}^\dagger \big[\hbar\sum_{ij}J_{ij}\hat{\sigma}^y_i\hat{\sigma}^y_j\big] \hat{U}\nonumber\\
		&=\hbar\sum_{ij} J_{ij} \Big(\hat{\sigma}^y_i\hat{\sigma}^y_j\Big) e^{i 2\zeta(t) \hat{\sigma}^z_i}  e^{i 2\zeta(t) \hat{\sigma}^z_j}
		\label{eq:movham}
	\end{align}
	Next, we apply the \textit{Jacobi Anger expansion}, $\displaystyle e^{iz \cos(\theta)} = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \mathcal{J}_n(z) e^{in\theta}$, where $\mathcal{J}_n$'s denote the  Bessel's function of first kind of $n$'th order. This allows for a Fourier series expansion of $\hat{H}^{mov}(t)$. Now, we introduce Rotating Wave Approximation (RWA), which, in the high frequency limit, approximates the Fourier modes with their coarse-grained values over long times. This allows us to average out all but the zeroth Fourier mode (see Appendix \ref{sec:AppendixA} for details), resulting in the approximation,
		\begin{multline}
			\hat{H}^{mov}(t)\approx \hat{H}^{_{RWA}} = \hbar\sum_{ij} J_{ij} \Big(\hat{\sigma}^y_i\hat{\sigma}^y_j\Big) \mathcal{J}_0\Big(\frac{4h}{\omega}\Big)\\
			\Bigg[\mathcal{J}_0\Big(\frac{4h}{\omega}\Big) + \cos(\frac{4h}{\omega})-\hat{\sigma}^z_i\hat{\sigma}^z_j \bigg\{\mathcal{J}_0\Big(\frac{4h}{\omega}\Big)\\
			- \cos(\frac{4h}{\omega})\bigg\} + \frac{i}{2} (\hat{\sigma}^z_i + \hat{\sigma}^z_j) \sin(\frac{4h}{\omega})\Bigg].
			\label{eq:movham1}
	\end{multline}
	Now, if the drive parameters $h$ and $\omega$  are {engineered} in such a way that the ratio ${4h}/{\omega}$ lies at one of the roots of $\mathcal{J}_0$~\footnote{This can be accomplished in the $\omega \gg J_0$ limit by ensuring that $h\gg J_0$.}, it is possible to nullify the dynamics of $\hat{H}_2$ during all $T_2-$cycles, hence inducing localization in the system. We have supported this result by numerical simulations, detailed in section~\ref{sec:level42}. There, $\hat{\sigma}^z$ is detected as an approximate integral invariant ~\cite{Keser2016,Dodonov1978}.

	\begin{figure*}[t!]

		\includegraphics[width=17.5cm]{sz_t_strongweakJ_ea_N_8.pdf}
		\caption{The time evolution of local magnetization for each spin at region A (Site(i)=0,1,2,3) and region B (Site(i)=4,5,6,7) is plotted for up to 80T, taking spin rotation error $\epsilon_A = 0.03$ and $\epsilon_B = 0.9$ with $g=\pi/T$.  In all three panels P, Q, and R, different spin-spin interactions such as long-range, intermediate range, short range, and nearest neighbor range are taken into account and plotted respectively from left to right, namely, (a, b,c,d) in the top row and (e,f,g,h) in the bottom row of each panel. The time evolution considering strong spin coupling ($J_0 = 0.2/T$) in the left panel (P) and weak spin coupling ($J_0 = 0.027/T$) in the middle panel (Q) is plotted  for the CDT/DL point (top panels of P \& Q) and away from the CDT/DL point (bottom panels of P \& Q). In the right panel (R), local magnetization for an effectively small spin rotational error $\epsilon_A = 0.05$ (top panel of R) and a larger $\epsilon_A = 0.1$ (bottom panel of R) are plotted at the CDT/DL point. At small $\epsilon_A=0.5$, the DTC-DMBL chimera is stable, while at $\epsilon_A=0.1$, DTC is stable only for long-range interaction, but in other spin ranges, the DTC phase melts at larger times.}
		\label{Fig:strong_weak_ea}
	\end{figure*}
	
	In order to demonstrate the emergence of the chimera state in our model, we present plots of the local magnetization, $\expval{\hat{S}^z_i (t)} \equiv \expval{\hat{\sigma}^z_i}{\Psi(t)}\;\forall i$ in the spin- chain. These have been obtained from numerical simulations of the Schr\"odinger dynamics, given by $\hat{H}(t)\ket{\Psi(t)}= i \hbar \pdv*{\ket{\Psi(t)}}{t}$, for the quantum many-body  state $\ket{\Psi(t)}$. The simulations have been executed for long times (up to $t=80\;T$, $\hbar$ set to unity) and multiple ranges of the power law interactions ($\beta = 0,1.5,2.5,\infty$), as well as  for weak and strong interaction amplitudes ( $J_0 = 0.072/T$ and $J_0 = 0.2/T$ respectively), parameters that are similar to those chosen by Sakurai in an earlier work~\cite{sakurai_phys_nodate}. In order to investigate the sustainability of the chimera, we set the rotational errors $\epsilon_A = 0.03$, $\epsilon_B = 0.9$. Additionally, to see the emergence of the chimera state in our model, we configure the periodic drive in $\hat{H}_2(t)$ with a high frequency $\omega=20$ for two sets of observations: one where $\chi\equiv4h/\omega$ lies at a root of $\mathcal{J}_0(\chi)$, \textit{i.e.}, the CDT/DL point, and one where  $4h/\omega$ away from any roots. 
	
		\textbf{Revised till here.}
		
	As shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig:strong_weak_ea}, at the CDT/DL points with strong coupling, the local magnetization for all types of spin-spin interaction shows periodic dynamics with double periods ($2T$) of the driving in region A, while that of region B is stable in time. Thus, regions A and B are the DTC and DMBL phases respectively. It indicates that two different phases of matter coexist in the same spin chain. Thus a chimera state emerges. In contrast, the system dynamics is unstable away from the CDT/DL point for both values of $J_0$. Similarly, in the weak interaction, the long-range $(\beta=0.0)$ shows stable DTC and DMBL phases. However, for intermediate($\beta = 1.5$), short-range ($\beta = 2.5$), and nearest neighbor range ($\beta = \infty$) interactions, DTC melts in a short period ($\sim$ 20 periods) in region A. These results are in agreement with previous work~\cite{sakurai_phys_nodate}.
	
	The stability of the DTC phase exhibits notable disparities between strong and weak coupling interactions. Specifically, even at the CDT/DL point, the DTC phase demonstrates greater stability in the presence of strong coupling as compared to weak coupling for interactions other than long-range interaction. The long-range interaction persists in a stable DTC for both strong and weak spin interactions. Thus the spin chain constitutes two existing simultaneous distinct phases of matter, a DTC and a ferromagnetic localized phase coupled together, manifesting a \textit{chimera} in the quantum spin chain. So in general, long-range coupling is the best candidate for constructing a DTC-ferromagnetic(DTC-DMBL) chimera.
	
	In addition, higher values of $\epsilon_A$ are applied to investigate the stability of DTC against larger rotational errors (see Fig.~\ref{Fig:strong_weak_ea}(R)). We have considered $\epsilon_A = 0.05$  and $0.1$ at fixed $\epsilon_B = 0.9$ for $\beta = (0.0, 1.5, 2.5, \infty$), fixed at CDT/DL points at strong coupling($J_0 = 0.2/T$). At a small $\epsilon_A=0.05$, DTC is stable for all types of spin-spin interactions. At large $\epsilon_A = 0.1$, the long-range($\beta=0$) DTC is stable, though, for other types of spin-spin interaction, DTC vanishes very fast, even after a couple of time periods. This corroborates the proffer that long-range interaction are the best choice for constructing a DTC-DMBL-chimera. 
	
	Next, to further investigate the DTC and DMBL phases coexisting further, let us consider the \textit{Floquet theory}, which is used to analyze the dynamics at the stroboscopic times. The effective Floquet Hamiltonian for two periods is given by,
	\begin{widetext}
		\begin{multline}
			H^{\mathrm{eff}} \approx\frac{\hbar}{2} \sum_{l,m\in A}J_{lm}\hat{\sigma}_l^y\hat{\sigma}_m^y +\frac{\hbar \epsilon_A \pi}{4} \sum_{\substack{l,m\in A\\l\neq m}} J_{lm}\hat{\sigma}^z_l\hat{\sigma}^y_m + \frac{\hbar}{2}\sum_{l,m\in B}J_{lm}\hat{\sigma}_l^y \hat{\sigma}_m^y + \frac{h\hbar}{\pi}\sum_{m \in B}\hat{\sigma}^z_m \\ -\frac{\hbar \pi \epsilon_A}{4T}\sum_{l\in A}\Bigg\{\hat{\sigma}^x_l \bigg[\cos(\hat{\theta}_l)\cos(\frac{4h}{\omega})+1 \bigg] + \hat{\sigma}^y_l \cos(\hat{\theta}_l)\sin(\frac{4h}{\omega})-\hat{\sigma}^z_l \sin(\hat{\theta}_l)\Bigg\},
		\label{eq:floq_eff3}
		\end{multline}
	\end{widetext}

	where $\displaystyle \hat{\theta}_l = 2 \Big(\sum_{m \in B}J_{lm}\hat{\sigma}^y_m \frac{T}{2} \Big)$ denotes a rotation acting on operator $\hat{\sigma}^y_l$ (See Appendix \ref{sec:AppendixB} for details).
	
	Similar to the previous work on chimera DTC model~\cite{sakurai_phys_nodate}, we observe that the rotation error $\epsilon_A$ plays an important role in chimera order in the spin system. To see this point, let us consider the extreme case, where $\epsilon_A=0$, then in Eq.~\eqref{eq:floq_eff3}  $H^\mathrm{eff}$ decouples into terms in regions A and B, \textit{i.e.}
	\begin{multline}
		H^{\mathrm{eff}}_{\epsilon_A=0} =  \frac{\hbar}{2}\Bigg( \sum_{l,m\in A} J_{lm} \hat{\sigma}^y_l\hat{\sigma}^y_m +\sum_{l,m\in B} J_{lm} \hat{\sigma}^y_l\hat{\sigma}^y_m\\+\frac{2h }{\pi}\sum_{m \in B}\hat{\sigma}^z_m\Bigg).
	\end{multline}
	At high drive  frequency, $\hat{\theta}_l \sim 0$. So when $0<\epsilon_A \ll 1$, the interaction term between two regions induced by $\epsilon_A$ depends on the $h$ and $\omega$ of the driving through the ratio $\chi=(4h/\omega)$.

	Furthermore, when $\chi = (2n+1)\pi$ with $n = 0,1,2\dots$, regions A and B become decoupled even at $\epsilon_A \neq 0$. To investigate the $h$ and $\omega$ dependency, we numerically obtain the Floquet quasi-energy by diagonalizing the 2T-effective Hamiltonian with $N=8$ and $\epsilon_A=0.03$. Its quasi-energies with different  $\chi=(4h/\omega)$'s are plotted in Fig.~\ref{Fig:quasienergy}. The distribution of the quasi-energy exhibits a regular periodic pattern confined in a Brillouin zone in $[-\frac{\pi}{2T}, \frac{\pi}{2T}]$~\cite{dutta2014}. The quasienergy level repulsion is the minimum at each odd integer multiple of $\pi$ in  $\chi$'s. This is in agreement with the analytical expression in Eq.\eqref{eq:floq_eff3} that a minimum in the eigenvalue of $H^{\mathrm{eff}}$ occurs at $(2n+1)\pi$ with $n=0,1,2\dots$.\, at which two regions A and B are completely decoupled even at $\epsilon_A \neq 0$. In contrast, when $0 < \epsilon_A \ll 1 $ and at the CDT/DL point, i.e., $\frac{4h}{\omega}$ is one of the roots of $\mathcal{J}_0\left(\frac{4h}{\omega}\right)$, as we have considered in the previous section, now the regions A and B are weakly coupled which is proportional to $\epsilon_A$. 	
	
	\section{\label{sec:level4}Regional  Magnetization \& Entanglement entropy}
	
	\subsection{\label{sec:level42} Regional Magnetization}
	The relative \textit{regional} nature of a segmented spin system can be better comprehended through the analysis of regional magnetization. The concept of regional magnetization, $\displaystyle M^z_{A/B}=\frac{2}{N}\sum_{i\in{A/B}}\expval{\hat{\sigma}^z_i(t)}$~\cite{sakurai_phys_nodate}, pertains to the magnetization exhibited by distinct sections of the system.
	\begin{figure}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width = 8cm]{clean_J_strong_MzAB_betas.pdf}
		\caption{Regional magnetization $M^z_{A/B}$ of spins of region A and B for weak spin-coupling (left panels) and strong spin-coupling(right panels) for different spin interactions defined by $\beta$'s up to 500T.}
		\label{Fig:regiogionalmag}
	\end{figure}
	The numerically simulated long time(500T) regional magnetization at region A and region B for both weak and strong spin coupling for different spin interactions are plotted in Fig.~\ref{Fig:regiogionalmag}. For both cases, weak($J_0=0.072/T$) and strong($J_0=0.2/T$) spin interactions are considered at the CDT/DL point. In region-B,  $M^Z_B$ is unity throughout time for both types of spin coupling. $M^Z_A$ exhibits differently. At weak coupling, $M^Z_A$ persists for a long time only for long-range ($\beta=0$) interaction, but at other ranges, it dissolves in due course of time. At strong coupling, $M^Z_A$ melts due course of time for all types of spin interactions.
	
	\subsection{\label{sec:level41} Entanglement Entropy}
	In the above sub-section, we have seen the macroscopic quantity (regional magnetization) to investigate the chimera order in our model. In this sub-section, to investigate microscopic aspects, we consider entanglement entropy (EE), which is widely used to measure the entanglement of a quantum state. It offers significant insights into quantum correlations and information storage capacities. The entanglement entropy, $S_{AB}$ between regions A and B can be mathematically expressed by the von Neumann entropy~\cite{bayat_entanglement_2022,mendes-santos_measuring_2020} of the reduced density matrix (RDM).   If the density matrix of the pure state $\ket{\psi}$ is $\rho = \ketbra{\psi}$, and the RDM for regions A or B are defined as $\rho_A$ or $\rho_B$ respectively, then the EE is given by,
	\begin{equation} 
		S_{AB} = -\Tr[\rho_A log(\rho_A)] = -\Tr[\rho_B log(\rho_B)].
		\label{eq:vonentrop}
	\end{equation}	
	\begin{figure}
		\begin{center}
			\includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{entangEntrp.pdf}
		\end{center}
		\caption{Entanglement Entropy has been computed at the CDT/DL point, considering weaker (left panel) and stronger (right panel) spin exchange couplings. The spin-spin coupling interaction in $\hat{H}_2$ during $T_2$ leads to the onset of a rise in EE. The growth rate of the subject in question remains notably slow, persisting even up to 2000 T.}
		\label{Fig:entangle}
	\end{figure}
	
	We have considered that initially in the spin chain, all of the spins are up. The corresponding density matrix is utilized to evaluate the EE numerically for a total time of 2000T and  plotted in Fig.~\ref{Fig:entangle} for both weak and strong spin-spin interactions. The EE is found to start rising from the onset of $T_2$ from where the spin-spin interaction $\textit{i.e.}$  $\displaystyle \sum_{ij}J_{ij}\hat{\sigma}^y_i\hat{\sigma}^y_j$ starts acting on the spin chain. The EE is found to rise very slowly, even after a sufficiently long time. It has underlying system dynamics that depends on coupling and spin rotation parameters. The coupling strength term of regional spins is kept strong. This prevents the relaxation of regional magnetization. The EE is found to rise faster in strong spin exchange coupling in comparison to weak spin exchange coupling. In Eq.\eqref{eq:floq_eff3} the coupling part of the effective Hamiltonian is proportional to the rotational error($\epsilon_A$), which is considered very small in value. This suppresses the interaction between regions A and B, which results in a small rise in the EE even after a long time period. Thus, a relatively small amount of information is shared between two regions through their inter-coupling.
	
	\section{\label{sec:level6} Robustness against Additional Static field}
	
	
	The enduring stability of the DTC-DMBL chimera is notably influenced by the drive parameters $h$ and $\omega$ in $\hat{H}_2$. The chimera order weakens even with a slight departure from the CDT/DL point. This prompts the question of how the chimera resists additional external fields, even when operating precisely at the CDT/DL point.
	
	To investigate the robustness of chimera order, we have introduced a static field $\displaystyle \hat{V}(\hat{\sigma}^\gamma) =\gamma \sum_{i=1}^{N} (\hat{\sigma}^x_i + \hat{\sigma}^y_i)$ in addition to the spin-flip operations in $\hat{H_1}$ and spin-spin interacting term along with transverse filed in $\hat{H}_2$, such that the additional static field acts on the system for the entire time period. We considered the drive parameters($h$, $\omega$) corresponding to CDT/DL points.
	\begin{figure}
		\begin{center}
			\includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{robustness_N_8.pdf}
		\end{center}
		\caption{Weak (top panel) and strong (bottom panel) additional static fields defined by $\gamma = J_0^s/5, J_0^s$ respectively, are applied in addition to the strong spin coupling interaction and transverse field at different spin-spin interaction ranges defined by $\beta = 0.0 (a,e), 1.5(b,f), 2.5(c,g), \infty(d,h)$. Local magnetization for each site(i) is plotted for 80 T.}
		\label{Fig:robustness}
	\end{figure}
	We have investigated for strong($\displaystyle \gamma= J_0^s=0.2/T$) and relatively weak ($\displaystyle \gamma= J_0^s/5=0.2/5T$) additional static fields. The numerical findings are presented in Fig.~\ref{Fig:robustness}. At weak $\gamma$, the spin-spin interaction dominates over the static field and dynamical localization persists, which results in stable DTC chimera. However, at a higher value of $\gamma$, the static field surpluses the exchange interaction among spins resulting in melting in  the DTC phase after a few time periods. At large times, a \textit{thermal-MBL} chimera phase manifests. Hence, a DTC-ferromagnetic chimera for a one-dimensional spin-1/2 chain can be realized that is robust against an additional external static field.	
	
	
	\section{\label{sec:level7} Discussion and Conclusion}
	
	We have found DTC-DMBL-chimera on a  disorder-free spin-1/2 chain by applying spin-flip operations regionally (with two regions labeled `A' and `B') and, afterward, a global dynamical localization by application of  a high-frequency drive. The weak spin coupling interaction is found to fail to persist in the DTC phase for all interactions except for long-range interaction. A strong spin exchange coupling interaction influences spins to resist relaxation in system dynamics, which yields a stable DTC phase regionally for a sufficiently long time for all types of spin-spin interactions. The stability of DTC in region A depends on the stability of DMBL in region B. The long-range spin interaction is fascinatingly robust against the exchange energy per spin. Long-range interaction enables DTC-DMBL-chimera at both weak and strong coupling interactions. We investigated tuning the spin rotational error at region A and found that at CDT/DL points, chimera can persist only at small rotational error $\epsilon_A$. In the effective Floquet Hamiltonian in Eq.~\ref{eq:floq_eff3} the inter-region interaction term is proportional to the spin rotation error $\epsilon_A$. At large $\epsilon_A$ there is higher coupling in between both the regions, which leads to DTC melting immediately for all interactions except for long-range. 
	
	An additional external static field is applied to investigate numerically the robustness of chimera against static perturbations. At small perturbations, the system is found to be robust by retaining the DTC phase in region A for a long time, while at higher perturbations, the system is no longer robust and the DTC melts immediately for all types of spin-spin interactions. The effective Floquet Hamiltonian depicts time period doubling at the reversal of global ferromagnetic order in the spin chain, which is supported by the exact numerics. The entanglement entropy rises at a very slow rate for both weak and strong regional spin interactions. Thus, the whole system is prevented from thermalization even when the DTC phase is dissolved in region A. This property can be utilized as quantum memory in applications. The proposed model and dynamics can be realized experimentally in trapped ions~\cite{sakurai_phys_nodate, Friedenauer2008}.
	
	In summary, we investigated the factors that contribute to the stability of the DTC-DMBL-chimera order. Long-range spin interaction is found to be the most suitable choice to construct DTC-DMBL-chimera where at CDT/DL points, other ranges of spin-spin interactions also contribute. Our analysis focuses on different types of spin-spin interaction defined by the power-law decay rule, the applied regional spin rotational error, the strength of spin-coupling interactions, the applied additional external static field, and periodic drive parameters. These variables are crucial in determining the stability of the chimera order.\\

	\section{\label{sec:AppendixA} DMBL in $T_2$ time interval}
	
	We have considered a spin-1/2 chain consisting of N numbers of spins, which  incorporates Heisenberg interaction following the power law decay rule. The spin chain is considered to be divided into two regions, A and B. In the first half of the time period ($T_1$), a spin flip operation takes place in region A. In the second half of the time period ($T_2$), the spin chain is driven by a global sinusoidal periodic drive \textit{s.t.} $h_D = -h\sin(\omega t)$ as shown in fig \ref{Fig:time_distribution}. This drive is controlled in such a way that in $T_2$, the system is localized by system dynamics.
	
	The Hamiltonian in $T_2$ is $\displaystyle \hat{H}_2(t) = \hbar\sum_{i>j} J_{ij}\hat{\sigma}^y_i\hat{\sigma}^y_j - \hbar h \sin(\omega t) \sum_i \hat{\sigma}^z_i$.
	Where $i$ and $j$ are the sites of spins. $J_{ij} = \frac{J_0}{|i-j|^\beta}$ is the Heisenberg interaction term which incorporates the interaction between the spins at positions  $i$ and $j$ for a power law decay with an exponent $\beta$. 
	The time evolution operator is found to be,
	\begin{equation}
		\hat{U}(t) = \exp \bigg[-\frac{i}{\hbar}\int_{\frac{T}{2}}^{\frac{T}{2}+t} (-h \sin(\omega t'))dt' \hbar\sum_i\hat{\sigma}^z_i\bigg]
		=\prod_{i} \exp\big[-i \hat{\sigma}^z_i\zeta(t)\big],
	\end{equation}
	where, $\displaystyle \zeta (t) = h\int_{\frac{T}{2}}^{\frac{T}{2}+t}  (-\sin(\omega t')dt') =\frac{h}{\omega}(1-\cos(\omega t))$.
	Now, the Hamiltonian in moving frame can be transformed to\cite{haldar_statistical_2022},
	\begin{align}
		\hat{H^{mov}} &= \hat{U}^\dagger(t) \hat{H}_2(t) \hat{U}(t)- i \hat{U}^\dagger(t) \partial_t \hat{U}(t) \nonumber\\
		&= \prod_{i} \exp\big[-i\hat{\sigma}^z_i \zeta(t)\big] \big[\hbar\sum_{ij}J_{ij}\hat{\sigma}^y_i\hat{\sigma}^y_j\big] \exp\big[ i\hat{\sigma}^z_i \zeta(t)\big]\nonumber\\
		&= \hbar\sum_{ij} J_{ij} e^{-i\hat{\sigma}^z_i \zeta(t)} e^{-i\hat{\sigma}^z_j  \zeta(t)}\Big(\hat{\sigma}^y_i\hat{\sigma}^y_j\Big)e^{i\hat{\sigma}^z_i \zeta(t)} e^{i\hat{\sigma}^z_j \zeta(t)}\nonumber\\
		&= \hbar\sum_{ij} J_{ij} \Big(\hat{\sigma}^y_i\hat{\sigma}^y_j\Big)e^{i2\hat{\sigma}^z_i \zeta(t)} e^{i2\hat{\sigma}^z_j \zeta(t)}\nonumber\\
		&= \hbar\sum_{ij} J_{ij} \Big(\hat{\sigma}^y_i\hat{\sigma}^y_j\Big) \Big(\mathbbm{1}\cos^2(2\zeta) -\hat{\sigma}^z_i\hat{\sigma}^z_j \sin^2(2\zeta) + i (\hat{\sigma}^z_i + \hat{\sigma}^z_j)\cos(2\zeta)\sin(2\zeta)\Big).
		\label{eq:hmovap1}
	\end{align}
	Here, we have utilized the expression, $\displaystyle \exp[ia(\hat{n}\cdot\vec{\sigma})] = \mathbbm{1} \cos(a) + i (\hat{n}\cdot\vec{\sigma})\sin(a)$.	We invoke the Jacobi-Anger expansion $\displaystyle e^{iz\cos(\omega t)} = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\mathcal{J}_n(z)e^{in\omega t}$\cite{arfkenmath}, where $\mathcal{J}_n(z)$ is the Bessel funciton of the first kind of n'th order and can be applied to expand the $\hat{H}^{mov}$ to expand in Fourier series expansion. The drive parameters $h$ and $\omega$ are independent of each other. In high frequency limit, Roatating Wave Approximaiton(RWA) approximates the Fourier modes with their long time  coarse-grain averages. This provides us with the option to average all the Fourier modes to zero, with the exception of only the zeroth order. Thus considering only $\mathcal{J}_0\left(\frac{4h}{\omega}\right)$ terms, the $\hat{H}^{mov}$ reduces to RWA-Hamiltonian ($\hat{H}^{_{RWA}}$) as given by,
	\begin{equation}
		\hat{H}^{mov}\approx \hat{H}^{_{RWA}} = \hbar\sum_{ij} J_{ij} \Big(\hat{\sigma}^y_i\hat{\sigma}^y_j\Big) \mathcal{J}_0\Big(\frac{4h}{\omega}\Big)\Bigg[\mathcal{J}_0\Big(\frac{4h}{\omega}\Big) + \cos(\frac{4h}{\omega}) -\hat{\sigma}^z_i\hat{\sigma}^z_j \bigg\{\mathcal{J}_0\Big(\frac{4h}{\omega}\Big) - \cos(\frac{4h}{\omega})\bigg\} + \frac{i}{2} (\hat{\sigma}^z_i + \hat{\sigma}^z_j) \sin(\frac{4h}{\omega})\Bigg].
		\label{eq:hrwa}
	\end{equation}	
	If $h$ and $\omega$ are controlled in such fashion that $\left(\frac{4h}{\omega}\right)$ is one the roots of Bessel's function of the first kind (${i.e.}$ $\mathcal{J}_0\left(\frac{4h}{\omega}\right)$), then $\hat{H}^{_{RWA}}$ vanishes totally, which results in localization during the second half cycles of time period. Eq.\eqref{eq:hrwa} describes the necessary and sufficient condition for DMBL in $T_2$ time cycle(s). 
	
	\section{\label{sec:AppendixB} Effective Floquet Hamiltonian}
	
	Floquet theory is an efficient methodology for evaluating the behavior of systems that undergo periodic driving by converting the time-varying problem into a time-invariant one. The Hamiltonian for a periodically driven system can be written as,
	\begin{equation*}
		\hat{H}(t) = \hat{H}_0 + \varepsilon \hat{H}_1(t)
	\end{equation*}
	The corresponding unitary evolution operator can be found from $\displaystyle{i\hbar \partial_t \hat{U}(t) = \hat{H}(t) \hat{U}(t)}$. Here $\displaystyle{\hat{U}(t) = \hat{U}(t+ nT)}$. For one time period T, the unitary operator $\displaystyle \hat{U}(T) = \hat{\mathcal{F}}$ is called the Floquet operator which is related to Floquet effective Hamiltonian ($\hat{H}_F$) as $\hat{U}(t) = \exp[-\frac{i}{\hbar}\hat{H}_F T]$~\cite{Eckardt_2015}. $\hat{H}_F\,(=H^\mathrm{eff})$ is derived from the original time-dependent Hamiltonian through a suitable transformation, given by, $\displaystyle \hat{H}_F(t) = \Bigg(\hat{H}(t) - i\hbar \pdv{t}\Bigg)$. Floquet Magnus expansion (FM) provides a systematic approach for analyzing the dynamics of quantum systems subjected to high-frequency periodic driving. By calculating successive terms in the expansion, one can derive an effective Hamiltonian that captures the essential physics of the system and allows for a deeper understanding of its behavior. $\hat{H}_F$ can be expanded as~\cite{Sen_2021},	
	\begin{align}
		\hat{H}_F &= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} H_F^{(n)}\nonumber\\
		H_F^{(0)} &= \frac{1}{T} \int_{t_0}^{T+t_0} dt H(t), \nonumber\\
		H_F^{(1)} &= \frac{1}{2!\hbar(i)T} \int_{t_0}^{T+t_0} dt_1  \int_{t_0}^{t_1} dt_2 [H(t_1), H(t_2)]\nonumber\\
		H_F^{(2)} &= -\frac{1}{3!\hbar^2 T^3} \int_{t_0}^{T+t_0} dt_1  \int_{t_0}^{t_1} dt_2 \int_{t_0}^{t_2} dt_3([H(t_1),[H(t_2), H(t_3)]] + [H(t_3),[H(t_2), H(t_1)]])
		\label{eq:app:mageff}
	\end{align} 
	Here each order `$n$' of the previous expansion in Eq.~\ref{eq:app:mageff} is hermitian~\cite{haldar_statistical_2022}.
	
	The proposed spin chain in Eq.\eqref{eq:cleanham}undergoes two time periods to construct a DTC. To obtain Floquet equation for the Hamiltonian in Eq.~\ref{eq:cleanham}, Floquet operator $\hat{\mathcal{F}}$ is acted twice on the Hamiltonian from time $t=0$ to $t=2T$ as,
	\begin{align*}
		\hat{\mathcal{F}}^2 &= \exp\Big(-\frac{i}{\hbar}\hat{H}_{\epsilon_A, 2T}^{\mathrm{eff}}2T\Big)\\ 
		&= \mathcal{T}\exp\Big(-\frac{i}{\hbar}\int_{\frac{3T}{2}}^{2T}\hat{H}_2 dt\Big)
		\exp\Big(-\frac{i}{\hbar}\hat{H}_1T_1\Big)\mathcal{T}\exp\Big(-\frac{i}{\hbar}\int_{\frac{T}{2}}^{T}\hat{H}_2 dt\Big)\exp\Big(-\frac{i}{\hbar}\hat{H}_1T_1\Big).
		\label{}
	\end{align*}
	Here $\mathcal{T}$ is the time-ordered exponential. The effective Floquet coefficients can be evaluated as given below,	
	\begin{align}
		H_F^{(0)} &= \frac{2}{T} \int_{\frac{T}{2}}^{T} dt H(t) = \frac{2}{T} \int_{\frac{T}{2}}^{T} dt \Bigg[\hbar\sum_{i\neq j} J_{ij} \hat{\sigma}^y_i \hat{\sigma}^y_j -\hbar h\sin(\omega t) \sum_i\hat{\sigma}^z_i\Bigg]= \hbar\sum_{i\neq j} J_{ij} \hat{\sigma}^y_i \hat{\sigma}^y_j + \frac{4h\hbar}{T \omega}\sum_i\hat{\sigma}^z_i,
	\end{align}	
	\begin{align}
		H_F^{(1)} &= \frac{1}{2!(i)\hbar} \frac{2}{T} \int_{\frac{T}{2}}^{T} dt_1  \int_{\frac{T}{2}}^{t_1} dt_2 [H(t_1), H(t_2)]\nonumber\\
		&= \frac{1}{2!(i)\hbar} \frac{2}{T}\int_{\frac{T}{2}}^{T} dt_1 \int_{\frac{T}{2}}^{t_1} dt_2\Bigg[2i\hbar\sum_{ij}^{}J_{ij}\hat{\sigma}^x_i\hat{\sigma}^y_j\Big\{h(t_2) -h(t_1)\Big\}\Bigg]\nonumber\\
		&= 0
	\end{align}	
	and,
	\begin{equation}
		H_F^{(2)} = -\frac{1}{3!\hbar^2 (T/2)^3} \int_{\frac{T}{2}}^{T} dt_1  \int_{{\frac{T}{2}}}^{t_1} dt_2 \int_{\frac{T}{2}}^{t_2} dt_3([H(t_1),[H(t_2), H(t_3)]] + [H(t_3),[H(t_2), H(t_1)]])= 0.    
	\end{equation}
	Thus the effective Hamiltonian in the interval $T_1\equiv[\frac{T}{2}, T]$ found to be,	
	\begin{equation}
		H^{\mathrm{eff}}\vert_{\frac{T}{2}, T} =  \hbar\sum_{i\neq j} J_{ij} \hat{\sigma}^y_i \hat{\sigma}^y_{j} + \frac{4h\hbar}{T \omega}\sum_i\hat{\sigma}^z_i.
	\end{equation} 	
	Similarly, the effective Hamiltonian for time interval $T_2\equiv[\frac{3T}{2}, 2T]$ is found as,	
	\begin{equation}
		H^{\mathrm{eff}}\vert_{\frac{3T}{2}, 2T} = \hbar\sum_{i\neq j} J_{ij} \hat{\sigma}^y_i \hat{\sigma}^y_{j} + \frac{4h\hbar}{T \omega}\sum_i\hat{\sigma}^z_i.
	\end{equation} 
	Let us consider, $\epsilon_A \neq 0$ and $\epsilon_B=1$. Also, we consider $\displaystyle \hat{V}_{\epsilon_A} = \exp\Big(\frac{i\epsilon_A \pi}{2}\sum_{l\in A}\hat{\sigma}^x_l\Big)$  and $\displaystyle \hat{\theta}_l = 2 \Big(\sum_{m \in B}J_{lm}\hat{\sigma}^y_m \frac{T}{2} \Big)$ which denotes a rotation acting on operator $\hat{\sigma}^y_l$, also we have contracted all the terms contributed from only region B. We consider, $\displaystyle {H}_B = \Big(\sum_{l,m\in B} J_{lm} \hat{\sigma}^y_l\hat{\sigma}^y_m + \frac{4h}{\omega T}\sum_{m \in B}\hat{\sigma^z_m}\Big)$. So, we can write,		
	\begin{multline}
		\mathcal{T}\exp\bigg\{-\frac{i}{\hbar}\int_{\frac{T}{2}}^{T} \hat{H}_2 dt\bigg\} = \exp\Bigg\{-i \bigg[ \sum_{l,m\in A}J_{lm} \hat{\sigma}_l^y\hat{\sigma}_m^y +\sum_{l,m\in B}J_{lm}
		\hat{\sigma_l^y}\hat{\sigma_m^y}-\sum_{\substack{%
				l \in A,\\
				m \in B\hfill}} J_{lm}\hat{\sigma}^y_l\hat{\sigma}^y_m\\+\frac{4h}{\omega T}\big( -\sum_{l\in A}^{}\hat{\sigma}^z_l + \sum_{m\in B}^{}\hat{\sigma}^z_m\big)\bigg]\frac{T}{2}\Bigg\},
	\end{multline}	
	and, $\displaystyle 
	\exp\Big(-\frac{i}{\hbar} \hat{H}_1 T_1\Big) = \exp\Bigg[\frac{-i(1-\epsilon_A)\pi}{2}\sum_{l \in A}\hat{\sigma}^x_l\Bigg].$
	Putting these values in the Floquet operator equation can be written as,    	
	\begin{align}
		\hat{\mathcal{F}}^2 
		=& \exp\Bigg\{-i \Big[ \sum_{l,m\in A}J_{lm} \hat{\sigma}^y_l\hat{\sigma}^y_m\frac{T}{2} +\sum_{l,m\in B}J_{lm} \hat{\sigma}^y_l\hat{\sigma}^y_m\frac{T}{2}+\sum_{\substack{%
				l \in A,\\
				m \in B\hfill}} J_{lm}\hat{\sigma}^y_l\hat{\sigma}^y_m\frac{T}{2} +\frac{2h}{\omega }\big( +\sum_{l\in A}^{}\hat{\sigma}^z_l + \sum_{m\in B}^{}\hat{\sigma}^z_m\big)\Big]\Bigg\} \hat{V}_{\epsilon_A} \nonumber\\
		& \hspace{1 cm}\exp\Bigg\{-i \Big[ \sum_{l,m\in A}J_{lm} \hat{\sigma}^y_l\hat{\sigma}^y_m\frac{T}{2} +\sum_{l,m\in B}J_{lm} \hat{\sigma}^y_l\hat{\sigma}^y_m\frac{T}{2}-\sum_{\substack{%
				l \in A,\\
				m \in B\hfill}} J_{lm}\hat{\sigma}^y_l\hat{\sigma}^y_m\frac{T}{2} +\frac{2h}{\omega}\big( -\sum_{l\in A}^{}\hat{\sigma}^z_l + \sum_{m\in B}^{}\hat{\sigma}^z_m\big)\Big]\Bigg\} \hat{V}_{\epsilon_A}\nonumber
		\end{align}
	We can simplify this expression further with the approximation that all operators with norm $\sim T$ approximately commute with each other, since all operators of $\mathcal{O}(T^2)$ can be neglected for sufficiently large $\omega\equiv 2\pi/T$. Thus, for instance, $e^{T\hat{A} + T\hat{B}}= e^{T\hat{A}}\; e^{T\hat{B}}\;e^{C_2 T^2\left[\hat{A}, \hat{B}\right]}\;e^{C_3 T^3\left[\hat{A},\left[\hat{A}, \hat{B}\right]\right]}\;\dots \approx e^{T\hat{A}} e^{T\hat{B}}$, once all higher order operators are neglected after applying the Zassenhaus' formula~\cite{Magnus1954}. This yields
		\begin{align}	
	\hat{\mathcal{F}}^2 	\approx& \exp\Bigg[-i \sum_{l,m\in A}J_{lm} \hat{\sigma}^y_l\hat{\sigma}^y_m\frac{T}{2}\Bigg] \exp\Bigg[-i\Big(\frac{2h}{\omega } \sum_{l\in A}^{}\hat{\sigma}^z_l + \sum_{l \in A}\frac{\hat{\theta}_{l}}{2}\hat{\sigma}^y_l\Big)\Bigg]\nonumber\\ 
		&\hspace{3cm} \hat{V}_{\epsilon_A} \exp\Bigg[i \Big(\sum_{l \in A}\frac{\hat{\theta}_{l}}{2}\hat{\sigma}^y_l + \frac{2h}{\omega} \sum_{l\in A}^{}\hat{\sigma}^z_l\Big)\Bigg] \exp\Bigg[-i\sum_{l,m\in A}J_{lm} \hat{\sigma}^y_l\hat{\sigma}^y_m\frac{T}{2}\Bigg] \exp\big[-i H_B T\big]\hat{V}_{\epsilon_A}.\nonumber
	\end{align}
	We now observe that $\hat{\theta}_l$ commutes with all operators that live in sector $A$, thus allowing us to treat it effectively as a $c-$number in the expression above. This allows for the simplification
	\begin{align}		
		\hat{\mathcal{F}}^2 	\approx& \exp\Bigg[-2i  \sum_{l,m\in A}J_{lm} \hat{\sigma}^y_l\hat{\sigma}^y_m\frac{T}{2}\Bigg]\exp\Bigg[\frac{i \epsilon_A \pi}{2}\sum_{l\in A}\Big\{\hat{\sigma}^x_l \cos(\hat{\theta}_l)\cos(\frac{4h}{\omega})\nonumber\\
		&\hspace{7cm}+ \hat{\sigma}^y_l \cos(\hat{\theta}_l)\sin(\frac{4h}{\omega})-\hat{\sigma}^z_l \sin(\hat{\theta}_l)\Big\}\Bigg] \exp\big[-i H_B T\big]\hat{V}_{\epsilon_A}\nonumber\\
		=&\exp\Bigg[-2i \sum_{l,m\in A}J_{lm} \hat{\sigma}_l^y\hat{\sigma}_m^y\frac{T}{2}\Bigg] \exp\Big(\frac{i\epsilon_A \pi}{2}\sum_{l\in A}\hat{\sigma^x_l}\Big) \exp\Bigg[\frac{i \epsilon_A \pi}{2}\sum_{l\in A}\Big\{\hat{\sigma}^x_l \cos(\hat{\theta}_l)\cos(\frac{4h}{\omega})\nonumber\\
		&\hspace{ 7cm}  +\hat{\sigma}^y_l \cos(\hat{\theta}_l)\sin(\frac{4h}{\omega})-\hat{\sigma}^z_l \sin(\hat{\theta}_l)\Big\}\Bigg]\exp\big[-i H_B T\big]\nonumber\\
		=&\exp\Bigg[-2i\sum_{l,m\in A}J_{lm}\hat{\sigma}^y_l\hat{\sigma}^y_m \frac{T}{2}\Bigg] \exp\Bigg[-i\epsilon_A \pi \sum_{\substack{l,m \in A\\l\neq m}}J_{lm} \hat{\sigma}^z_l\hat{\sigma}^y_m\frac{T}{2}\Bigg] \exp\Bigg[\frac{i \epsilon_A \pi}{2}\sum_{l\in A}\Bigg\{\hat{\sigma}^x_l\Bigg( \cos(\hat{\theta}_l)\cos(\frac{4h}{\omega})+1\Bigg)\nonumber\\
		&\hspace{7cm} +\hat{\sigma}^y_l \cos(\hat{\theta}_l)\sin(\frac{4h}{\omega})-\hat{\sigma}^z_l \sin(\hat{\theta}_l)\Bigg\}\Bigg] \exp\big[-i H_B T\big].

	\end{align}
	Now, utilizing the relation $\displaystyle \hat{\mathcal{F}}^2 = \exp\Big(-\frac{i}{\hbar}H^{\mathrm{eff}}2T\Big)$, the effective Floquet Hamiltonian can be found as,
	\begin{multline}
		H^{\mathrm{eff}} \approx\frac{\hbar}{2} \sum_{l,m\in A}J_{lm}\hat{\sigma}_l^y\hat{\sigma}_m^y +\frac{\hbar \epsilon_A \pi}{4} \sum_{\substack{l,m\in A\\l\neq m}} J_{lm}\hat{\sigma}^z_l\hat{\sigma}^y_m + \frac{\hbar}{2}\sum_{l,m\in B}J_{lm}\hat{\sigma}_l^y \hat{\sigma}_m^y + \frac{h\hbar}{\pi}\sum_{m \in B}\hat{\sigma}^z_m \\ -\frac{\hbar \pi \epsilon_A}{4T}\sum_{l\in A}\Bigg\{\hat{\sigma}^x_l \bigg[\cos(\hat{\theta}_l)\cos(\frac{4h}{\omega})+1 \bigg] + \hat{\sigma}^y_l \cos(\hat{\theta}_l)\sin(\frac{4h}{\omega})-\hat{\sigma}^z_l \sin(\hat{\theta}_l)\Bigg\}.
		\label{eq:app:nfloq_eff3}
	\end{multline}
	In the limit of very high frequencies, $T\rightarrow 0$. Therefore,  $\hat{\theta}_l \rightarrow 0$. Thus, the regions $A$ and $B$ decouple in eq.\eqref{eq:app:nfloq_eff3}, and effective fields $\sim \hat{\sigma}^{x,y}_l$ are appended to the Hamiltonian in region $A$ whose intensities depend only on $\epsilon_A$, and the ratio $\frac{4h}{\omega}$. When $\frac{4h}{\omega}$ is an odd multiple of $\pi$, the two regions decouple completely in the ultra-high frequency limit.

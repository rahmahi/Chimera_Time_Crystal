	abstract = {Gravity is usually considered to be irrelevant as far as the physics of elementary particles is concerned and, in particular, in the context of the spontaneous symmetry breaking ({SSB}) mechanism. We describe a version of the {SSB} mechanism in which gravity plays a direct role. We work in the context of diffeomorphism invariant gauge theories, which exist for any nonabelian gauge group G, and which have second-order in derivatives field equations. We show that any (nontrivial) vacuum solution of such a theory gives rise to an embedding of the group {SU}(2) into G, and thus breaks G down to {SU}(2) times its centralizer in G. The components of the connection charged under {SU}(2) can then be seen to describe gravitons, with the {SU}(2) itself playing the role of the chiral half of the Lorentz group. Components charged under the centralizer describe the usual Yang-Mills gauge bosons. The remaining components describe massive particles. This breaking of symmetry explains (in the context of models considered) how gravity and Yang-Mills can come from a single underlying theory while being so different in the physics they describe. Further, varying the vacuum solution, and thus the embedding of {SU}(2) into G, one can break the Yang-Mills gauge group as desired, with massless gauge bosons of one vacuum acquiring mass in another. There is no Higgs field in our version of the {SSB} mechanism, the only variable is a connection field. Instead of the symmetry breaking by a dedicated Higgs field pointing in some direction in the field space, our theories break the symmetry by choosing how the group of internal gauge rotations of gravity (the chiral half of the Lorentz group) sits inside the full gauge group.},

We report the observation of a limit cycle phase in a continuously pumped dissipative atom-cavity system that is characterized by emergent oscillations in the intracavity photon number. The phase of the oscillation was found to be random for different realizations, and hence, this dynamical many-body state breaks continuous time translation symmetry spontaneously. Furthermore, the observed limit cycles are robust against temporal perturbations and therefore demonstrate the realization of a continuous time crystal.},

Spontaneous modification of discrete time-translation symmetry in periodically-forced physical systems can create a discrete time crystal ({DTC}) constituting a state of matter possessing properties like temporal rigid long-range order and coherence, which are inherently desirable for quantum computing and information processing. Despite their appeal, experimental demonstrations of {DTCs} are scarce and significant aspects of their behavior remain unexplored. Here, we report the experimental observation and theoretical investigation of {DTCs} in a Kerr-nonlinear optical microcavity. Empowered by the self-injection locking of two independent lasers with arbitrarily large frequency separation simultaneously to two same-family cavity modes and a dissipative Kerr soliton, this versatile platform enables realizing long-awaited phenomena such as defect-carrying {DTCs} and phase transitions. Combined with monolithic microfabrication, this room-temperature system paves the way for chip-scale time crystals supporting real-world applications outside sophisticated laboratories.},

Here we first present a definition of time crystals based on the time-dependent correlation functions of the order parameter.

A periodically driven system is naively expected to lose all memory of its initial state due to thermalization, yet this can be avoided in the presence of many-body localization.

Here, we report the observation of a discrete time crystal on a chain consisting of 57 superconducting qubits on a state-of-the-art quantum computer. We probe random initial states and compare the cases of vanishing and finite disorder to distinguish many-body localization from prethermal dynamics. We further report results on the dynamical phase transition between the discrete time crystal and a thermal regime, which is observed via critical fluctuations in the system’s subharmonic frequency response and a substantial speedup of spin depolarization.},

	abstract = {Discrete time crystals ({DTCs}) are phases of matter characterized by the presence of an observable evolving with {nT} periodicity under a T-periodic Hamiltonian, where n{\textgreater}1 is an integer insensitive to small parameter variations. In particular, {DTCs} with n=2 have been extensively studied in periodically quenched and kicked spin systems in recent years. In this paper, we study the emergence of {DTCs} in a many-body system whose semiclassical mean-field dynamics is nonintegrable, using a rather simple model depicting a harmonically driven spin chain. We advocate to first employ a semiclassical approximation to arrive at a mean-field Hamiltonian and then identify the parameter regime at which {DTCs} exist, with standard tools borrowed from studies of classical chaos. Specifically, we seek symmetric-breaking solutions by examining the stable islands on the Poincaré surface of section of the mean-field Hamiltonian. We then turn to the actual many-body quantum system, evaluate the stroboscopic dynamics of the total magnetization in the full quantum limit, and verify the existence of {DTCs}. Our effective and straightforward approach indicates that in general {DTCs} are one natural aspect of many-body quantum chaos with mixed classical phase space structure. Our approach can also be applied to general time-periodic systems, which is thus promising for finding {DTCs} with n{\textgreater}2 and opening possibilities for exploring {DTCs} properties beyond their time-translational breaking features.},

This is in sharp contrast to conventional bosonic and fermionic quadratic disordered Hamiltonians that show single-particle (Anderson) localization.

However, experimental realization of {MBL} in solid-state systems has remained challenging. Here, we report evidence of a possible phonon {MBL} phase in disordered {GaAs}/{AlAs} superlattices. Through grazing-incidence inelastic X-ray scattering, we observe a strong deviation of the phonon population from equilibrium in samples doped with {ErAs} nanodots at low temperature, signaling a departure from thermalization. This behavior occurs within finite phonon energy and wavevector windows, suggesting a localization-thermalization crossover. We support our observation by proposing a theoretical model for the effective phonon Hamiltonian in disordered superlattices, and showing that it can be mapped exactly to a disordered 1D Bose–Hubbard model with a known {MBL} phase. Our work provides momentum-resolved experimental evidence of phonon localization, extending the scope of {MBL} to disordered solid-state systems.},

In a periodically driven classical thermodynamic system, freezing at high ω occurs when 1/ω is much smaller than the characteristic relaxation time of the system and hence the freezing always increases there as ω is increased. Here, in the contrary, we see surprising nonmonotonic freezing behavior of the response with ω, showing curious peak-valley structure. Quite interestingly, the entire system tends to freeze almost absolutely (the freezing peaks) when driven with a certain combination of driving parameters values (amplitude and ω) due to coherent suppression of dynamics of the quantum many-body modes, which has no classical analog. We demonstrate this new freezing phenomenon analytically (supported by large-scale numerics) for a general class of integrable quantum spin systems.},

The existence of a dominant energy scale, {hxD}, can generate considerable structure in an effective description of a system that, in the absence of the drive, is nonintegrable and interacting, and does not host localization. In particular, we uncover points of freezing in the space of drive parameters (frequency and amplitude). At those points, the dynamics is severely constrained due to the emergence of an almost exact, local conserved quantity, which scars the entire Floquet spectrum by preventing the system from heating up ergodically, starting from any generic state, even though it delocalizes over an appropriate subspace. At large drive frequencies, where a naïve Magnus expansion would predict a vanishing effective (average) drive, we devise instead a strong-drive Magnus expansion in a moving frame. There, the emergent conservation law is reflected in the appearance of the “integrability” of an effective Hamiltonian. These results hold for a wide variety of Hamiltonians, including the Ising model in a transverse field in any dimension and for any form of Ising interaction. The phenomenon is also shown to be robust in the presence of two-body Heisenberg interactions with any arbitrary choice of couplings. Furthermore, we construct a real-time perturbation theory that captures resonance phenomena where the conservation breaks down, giving way to unbounded heating. This approach opens a window on the low-frequency regime where the Magnus expansion fails.},

In this Letter, we propose a simple disorder-free periodically driven model that exhibits nontrivial {DTC} order stabilized by Stark many-body localization ({MBL}). We demonstrate the existence of {DTC} phase by analytical analysis from perturbation theory and convincing numerical evidence from observable dynamics. The new {DTC} model paves a new promising way for further experiments and deepens our understanding of {DTC}. Since the {DTC} order doesn't require special quantum state preparation and the strong disorder average, it can be naturally realized on the noisy intermediate-scale quantum ({NISQ}) hardware with much fewer resources and repetitions. Moreover, besides the robust subharmonic response, there are other novel robust beating oscillations in Stark-{MBL} {DTC} phase which are absent in random or quasi-periodic {MBL} {DTC}.},

We prove a theorem that states that such a prethermal regime persists until times that are nearly exponentially long in the ratio of certain couplings to the drive frequency. By similar techniques, we can also construct stationary systems that spontaneously break continuous time-translation symmetry. Furthermore, we argue that for driven systems coupled to a cold bath, the prethermal regime could potentially persist to infinite time.},

In addition, its quantum fluctuations are described by regular Floquet theory. Furthermore, it is also a time crystal, presenting long-range time-periodic order. However, this crystalline behavior is very different to that of conventional Floquet discrete time crystals: here, there is no external periodic driving, energy is conserved, and the nature of the spontaneous symmetry breaking is continuous instead of discrete. We demonstrate that spontaneous many-body Floquet states can emerge in a variety of canonical many-body problems, ranging from interacting fermions to Bose-Hubbard models. We specifically show that a spontaneous many-body Floquet state is a universal intrinsic state of a one-dimensional flowing atom condensate, both subsonic and supersonic, resulting from a dynamical phase transition and robust against external perturbations and quantum fluctuations, proposing also realistic experimental scenarios for its observation. A spontaneous many-body Floquet state not only represents a realization of a continuous time crystal, but also another paradigm in Floquet physics.},

This state of broken symmetry, which usually coexists with a stable spatially symmetric state, has intrigued the nonlinear dynamics community since its discovery in the early 2000s. Recent experiments have led to increasing interest in the origin and dynamics of these states. Here we review the history of research on chimera states and highlight major advances in understanding their behaviour.},

	abstract = {Chimeras are this year coming of age since they were first observed by Kuramoto and Battogtokh in 2002 in a one-dimensional network of complex Ginzburg–Landau equations. What started as an observation of a peculiar coexistence of synchronized and desynchronized states, almost two decades latter turned out to be an important new paradigm of nonlinear dynamics at the interface of physical and life sciences. Chimeras have been observed in uni-hemispheric sleep of aquatic mammals and migratory birds, in electrocorticographic recordings of epileptic seizures, and in neural bump states that are central to the coding of working memory and visual orientation. Chimera states have also been observed experimentally in physical systems, for example in liquid crystal light modulators, and they have been linked to power grids outages and optomechanics. Here we present a major review of chimeras, dedicated to all aspects of their theoretical and practical existence. We cover different dynamical systems in which chimera states have been observed, different types of chimeras, and different mathematical methods used for their analysis. We also review the importance of network structure for the emergence of chimeras, as well as different schemes aimed at controlling the symmetry breaking spatiotemporal pattern. We conclude by outlining open challenges and opportunities for future research entailing chimeras.},

Up to date, they are well studied in open quantum systems, where an external drive allows us to break discrete {TTS}, ultimately leading to Floquet time crystals. At the same time, genuine time crystals for closed quantum systems are believed to be impossible. In this study we propose a form of a Hamiltonian for which the unitary dynamics exhibits the time crystalline behavior and breaks continuous {TTS}. This is based on a spin-1/2 many-body Hamiltonian which has long-range multispin interactions in the form of spin strings, thus bypassing previously known no-go theorems. We show that quantum time crystals are stable to local perturbations at zero temperature. Finally, we reveal the intrinsic connection between continuous and discrete {TTS}, thus linking the two realms.},

	abstract = {The periodically driven quantum Ising chain has recently attracted a large attention in the context of Floquet engineering. In addition to the common paramagnet and ferromagnet, this driven model can give rise to new topological phases. In this work, we systematically explore its quantum phase diagram by examining the properties of its Floquet ground state. We specifically focus on driving protocols with time-reversal invariant points, and demonstrate the existence of an infinite number of distinct phases. These phases are separated by second-order quantum phase transitions, accompanied by continuous changes of local and string order parameters, as well as sudden changes of a topological winding number and of the number of protected edge states. When one of these phase transitions is adiabatically crossed, the correlator associated to the order parameter is nonvanishing over a length scale which shows a Kibble-Zurek scaling. In some phases, the Floquet ground state spontaneously breaks the discrete time-translation symmetry of the Hamiltonian. Our findings provide a better understanding of topological phases in periodically driven clean integrable models.},

	abstract = {We analyze the quantum dynamics of periodically driven, disordered systems in the presence of long-range interactions. Focusing on the stability of discrete time crystalline ({DTC}) order in such systems, we use a perturbative procedure to evaluate its lifetime. For 3D systems with dipolar interactions, we show that the corresponding decay is parametrically slow, implying that robust, long-lived {DTC} order can be obtained. We further predict a sharp crossover from the stable {DTC} regime into a regime where {DTC} order is lost, reminiscent of a phase transition. These results are in good agreement with the recent experiments utilizing a dense, dipolar spin ensemble in diamond [Nature (London) 543, 221 (2017)]. They demonstrate the existence of a novel, critical {DTC} regime that is stabilized not by many-body localization but rather by slow, critical dynamics. Our analysis shows that the {DTC} response can be used as a sensitive probe of nonequilibrium quantum matter.},

This Floquet time crystal is robust under perturbations of the kicking protocol, its existence being intimately linked to the underlying Z2 symmetry breaking of the time-independent model. We show that the model being infinite range and having an extensive amount of symmetry-breaking eigenstates is essential for having the time-crystal behavior. In particular, we discuss the properties of the Floquet spectrum, and show the existence of doublets of Floquet states which are, respectively, even and odd superposition of symmetry-broken states and have quasienergies differing of half the driving frequencies, a key essence of Floquet time crystals. Remarkably, the stability of the time-crystal phase can be directly analyzed in the limit of infinite size, discussing the properties of the corresponding classical phase space. Through a detailed analysis of the robustness of the time crystal to various perturbations we are able to map the corresponding phase diagram. We finally discuss the possibility of an experimental implementation by means of trapped ions.},

For the transverse Ising model, the spreading of correlations and growth of entanglement are computed using numerical matrix product state techniques, and are compared with exact solutions for the fermionic tunneling model. We identify transitions between regimes with and without an apparent linear light cone for correlations, which correspond closely between the two models. For long-range interactions (in terms of separation distance r, decaying slower than 1/r), we find that despite the lack of a light cone, correlations grow slowly as a power law at short times, and that—depending on the structure of the initial state—the growth of entanglement can also be sublinear. These results are understood through analytical calculations, and should be measurable in experiments with trapped ions.},

We are specifically interested in the thermodynamics of the qubit. It is well known that by combining the Markovian approximation with Floquet theory it is possible to derive a stochastic Schrödinger equation in for the state of the qubit. We follow here a different approach. We use Floquet theory to embed the time-non autonomous qubit dynamics into time-autonomous yet infinite dimensional dynamics. We refer to the resulting infinite dimensional system as the dressed-qubit. Using the Markovian approximation we derive the stochastic Schrödinger equation for the dressed-qubit. The advantage of our approach is that the jump operators are ladder operators of the Hamiltonian. This simplifies the formulation of the thermodynamics. We use the thermodynamics of the infinite dimensional system to recover the thermodynamical description for the driven qubit. We compare our results with the existing literature and recover the known results.},
